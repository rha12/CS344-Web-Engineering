# Task:
BBC is one of the famous public broadcasting companies. BBC broadcast news in several ways e.g. television, radio, electronic (via internet) etc. They can be accessed over the internet through their web site: www.bbc.com. The layout of this website can be designed using HTML tables. When carefully observing this layout, one can easily identify that this design consists of several nested tables. The tables are highlighted in the image below.

Design a web page which has similar layout as shown in the above screenshots. Your layout must be based on tables (no divs). You are encouraged to use either internal CSS (using style attribute). You are also encouraged to use different HTML tags we learned so far. 
## Hints:
1.	Feel free to browse BBC’s website and look into its page source to see how the layout is designed.
2.	You can change the color scheme as per your choice. 
3.	BBC’s website has a menu (More) and a search bar. You can skip both in your layout.
4.	You are encouraged to use most of the HTML tags you have learned so far or even new tags, which you can learn from W3Schools.
5.	Make good use of HTML colors, fonts, font-family, font-sizes and other styles for the look and feel of the web page.
6.	Make sure to test your website with different resolutions by changing the resolution of your screen.
7.	High resolution images of both screenshots can be seen by using zoom in features of MS Word.
