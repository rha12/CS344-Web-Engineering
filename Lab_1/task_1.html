<h2>ABOUT ME</h2><p>I am organised, focused and ambitious person who sets goals and achieve them. 
I am doing Software Engineering from SEECS, NUST. My aim is to become quality software engineering 
and to polish my skills to an extent that I will be able to add value to the society. 
My main focus is to raise my self to the level where I will be able to solve real-world problems 
</p> 
<h2>MY INTERESTS</h2> 
<h3>Machine Learning</h3><p>I am enthausiastic about learning Machine Learning. 
Machine Learning(ML) is everywhere in our daily life. We start interacting with ML model from 
moment we wakeup like we do web search about weather forecast which is a ML model predicting 
weather based on some data. The growing use of ML raise my curiosity about ML and encourages me to learn about this field</p> 
<h3>Data Science</h3><p>DataScience is another field that intriques me. It is said 
data is the new oil which not so different from today's reality. We are generating tones of data 
on daily bases. Every search made on the search engine adds to data being collected. 
Almost all the companies have and are hiring best data scientists to increase their sales. 
</p> 
<h2>MY HOBBIES</h2><h3>Horse riding</h3><p>So far the best hobby I have developed over the years. Horses have a special connection with their riders. 
I am not sure about it but I think horses are the most emotional animals and they share a special bond with their tamer. 
But one thing I know for sure that horses riding is the best source of dopamine. The dopamine rush you feel after 
riding a horse is beyond limits. Your whole mode can shift in a short period of time. 
Horse riding is my source of happiness.
