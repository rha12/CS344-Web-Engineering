# Task:
In your previous lab, you have designed a website using tables which is similar to BBC’s website. Tables can be used to define the structure of a website; however, they are less flexible and difficult to handle complex structures. The layout of the BBC’s website can be designed using divisions (DIVs). A screenshot of the website is shown below:

Design a web page which has similar layout as shown in the above screenshots. Your layout must be based on DIVs (no tables). You are encouraged to use either internal CSS (using style attribute). You are also encouraged to use different HTML tags we learned so far. 
## Hints:
1.	Feel free to browse BBC’s website and look into its page source to see how the layout is designed.
2.	You can change the color scheme as per your choice. 
3.	BBC’s website has a menu (More) and a search bar. You can skip both in your layout.
4.	You are encouraged to use most of the HTML tags you have learned so far or even new tags, which you can learn from W3Schools.
5.	Make good use of HTML colors, fonts, font-family, font-sizes and other styles for the look and feel of the web page.
6.	Make sure to test your website with different resolutions by changing the resolution of your screen.
7.	High resolution images of both screenshots can be seen by using zoom in features of MS Word.
